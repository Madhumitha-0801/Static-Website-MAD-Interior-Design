<h2><strong>Types Paint Sheens or Paint Finishes</strong></h2>

The gloss level or the sheen is a determined by the ratio of binder and other materials. As the amount of binder in the paint increases, the surface will become smoother. When the binder is less, the pigments of grain become visible, and the surface becomes rough.

Based on the levels of sheen or gloss level, paints can be classified as follows.

&nbsp;
